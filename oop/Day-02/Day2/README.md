# ITI C# Tasks – OOP (Day 002)

This project is a C# Console Application developed as part of ITI training.
It focuses on practicing arrays, OOP concepts, validation, and SOLID principles
through a set of independent tasks implemented in a single project.

---

## 📌 Implemented Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Find Minimum and Maximum in an Array
- An integer array is defined and printed to the console.
- A utility method is used to determine the minimum and maximum values.
- Logic is separated into a helper class to improve reusability.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Sort an Array
- The same integer array is sorted in ascending order.
- Sorting is performed in-place without creating a new array.
- Results are printed after sorting.

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Search for a Number in an Array
- The user enters a number to search for.
- The program returns the index of the number if found.
- If the number does not exist, a clear message is displayed.

---

### 🔹 Task 4: Read and Write a 2D Array
- The program reads a two-dimensional array from user input.
- Array dimensions are handled dynamically.
- The 2D array is printed in a structured format.

---

### 🔹 Task 5: Date of Birth Calculation
- User input is validated for:
  - Year
  - Month
  - Day
- Leap years are handled correctly.
- **Single Responsibility Principle** is applied:
  - One class is responsible for validation.
  - Another class is responsible for date calculation.

---

### 🔹 Task 6: Simple Calculator
- Supports basic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Applied SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**
  - **Open/Closed Principle**
  - **Dependency Injection**
- Each operation is implemented in a separate class.
- Operator validation is applied before execution.

---

### 🔹 Task 7: Employee Management System
- Employees are stored in a collection.
- Enumerator (`foreach`) is used to loop through employees.
- Validation includes:
  - Ensuring employee ID is unique.
  - Salary range validation.
- Employee data is printed after insertion.
